              "'Narendra Damodardas Modi is an Indian politician who is currently serving as the 14th prime minister of India. He was born on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and is known for his pro-business and nationalist policies. \\n\\nModi joined the BJP in 1987 and gradually rose through the ranks of the party. He served as the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and during his tenure, he was known for his efficient administration and focus on development and industrialization. \\n\\nIn the 2014 Indian general election, Modi led the BJP to a landslide victory, becoming the first prime minister since 1984 to win a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Indian parliament). He has implemented a number of economic reforms aimed at attracting foreign investment and boosting growth, including the demonetization of high-value currency notes and the introduction of a goods and services tax. \\n\\nModi has also taken a hard line on national security issues, including authorizing surgical strikes against alleged terrorist targets in Pakistan. His government has also been criticized for its handling of religious and social tensions in the country, with some accusing it of encouraging Hindu nationalism and discriminating against minority communities. \\n\\nIn the 2019 Indian general election, Modi won a second term as prime minister with an even larger majority for the BJP. His current term is set to last until 2024.'"
